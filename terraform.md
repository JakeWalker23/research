# Terraform

Terraform allows you to provision infrastructure by writing code. Instead of using the GUI to provision, you can write configuration files that can operate on multiple clouds!


# Terraform Commands

Usage: terraform [global options] <subcommand> [args]

Main commands:
```
  init          Prepare your working directory for other commands
```

```
  validate      Check whether the configuration is valid
```

```
  plan          Show changes required by the current configuration
```

```
  apply         Create or update infrastructure
```

```
  destroy       Destroy previously-created infrastructure
```

```
  show          Show the current state or a saved plan
```

```
  output        Show output values from your root module
```

```
  state         Advanced state management
```

```
  test          Experimental support for module integration testing
```



# Reflection

I've used terraform to provision a docker image containing nginx. Using Terraform I was able to provision it quickly. Using variables, you can see how this could extend into different environments.
